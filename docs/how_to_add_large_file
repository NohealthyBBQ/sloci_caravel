(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35518688/git-lfs-refused-to-track-my-large-files-properly-until-i-did-the-following)


git lfs track "*.zip"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Updated the attributes"
git push
git add my_large_file.zip
git lfs ls-files

And here I would ensure that I saw my_large_file.zip being tracked.

git commit -m "Now I am adding the large file"
git push

Do NOT use git lfs anymore as E-fabless doesn't support it. Need to compress it to user_analog_project_wrapper.gds.gz file

$gzip user_analog_project_wrapper.gds
